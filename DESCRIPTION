Description:
    The package adds a theme for ggplot2() with the PoMS colours
    and some agreed upon look for figures used by the PoMS project.
    It is called theme_PoMS() and is added as other themes in the end of your
    ggplot functions. The package also includes a save_poms_plot function that finalise
    and saves the plot. This includes adding an optional Lund university logo at the top 
    right corner. Furthermore, it adds a footer with an Source for the 
    plot, and an optional logo in the bottom right corner.
