Description:
    The package adds a theme for ggplot2() with the RestPoLL colours
    and some agreed upon look for figures used by the RestPoLL project.
    It is called theme_RestPoLL() and is added as other themes in the end of your
    ggplot functions. The package also includes a save_restpoll_plot function
    that finalise and saves the plot. This includes adding an optional RestPoLL logo
    at the top right corner. Furthermore, it adds a footer with a European flag
    and EU-funding text in the bottom right corner.
